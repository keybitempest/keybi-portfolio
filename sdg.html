    <h1>Climate Action</h1>
    <img src="sdg.png" alt="sdgpic" class="sdg" height="130px" width="130px"><p> Climate Action (SDG13) aims to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. It seeks to enhance resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards, integrate climate change measures into policies and plans, and improve education and awareness for effective action. Additionally, it emphasizes mobilizing financial resources and promoting equitable planning to support vulnerable countries and communities in addressing climate challenges.</p>    
    <p>As a web developer, I can align my skills with SDG 13 by creating platforms that raise awareness about climate change and promote sustainable practices. For instance, I could build websites that educate users about reducing their carbon footprint.. I also aim to optimize my projects for energy efficiency by using green hosting, lightweight designs, and eco-friendly development practices. By collaborating with environmental organizations, I can amplify their impact online and empower more people to take climate action.</p>
